### About Me
After working 5 years in two tech companies, I decided to come out on my own to become a freelancing data consultant. I hope that from my experiences working in tech companies, I can have give smaller companies a boost to their analytics journeys. 

Topics that interest me include philosophy, economics, tech, data analytics, art and architecture.
